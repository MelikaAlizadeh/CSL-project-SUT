For running the programs you should use linux terminal and enter ./run.sh p1 or ./run.sh p2

The first problem is an implementation of mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, %) for big numbers(such as 128 and 256 bit numbers).
The program works like this: after running the program you should enter the operation character and then give two numbers. This process will continue as long as you enter character and two numbers but if you enter 'q' the program will end.

The second problem is an implementation of elimination with matrices.
The program works like this: after running the program you should enter numbers of rows or columns of the matrix then enter the numbers of in this matrix and then if there was no answer for the equation you get Impossible and if there was an answer for the equation you get the right result in double precision.
